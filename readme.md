# Week 4 - Shrek, Paper, Scissors!

This week's challenge was to create a timed functioning trivia game that meets the following acceptance criteria:

- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the Start button
    - THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
    - THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    - THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    - THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
    - THEN I can save my initials and score
